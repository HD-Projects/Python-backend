# Email Backend

This is a project by 2 Students in the **VRC competive robotics program**, beacuse our season was ended abruptly because of COVID-19. We had plenty of extra time so we wanted a project to work on so we made a game and started work on a email client

## Overview

* We have been working on a game like asteroids the GitHub page is [Here](https://github.com/The-Bit-One/Asteroid_Dodge). We have also made a platfomer game the link to the website is [Here](https://sites.google.com/site/playdoctorcabbage/home) this will be the email backend we use to send all the emails for the mailing lists for these games.
* We started this because we have tried mailchimp and it sent all of the emails to our junk box so we wanted to find a way that they would automaticly go into your important inbox
